},

Template for differing number / complexity of effects. Seperate each effect with ,'s. No comma if only 1 effect. This is to understand each line in the template above.
	EFFECT-NAME : {EFFECT-AFFECT} - single effect
	EFFECT-NAME : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT} - multiple effect-affects in one effect
	EFFECT-NAME : {"Option1" : {EFFECT-AFFECT}, "Option2" : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT}} - Multiple possiblities for EffectAffects such as this or that, for each option start with "OptionNUMBER" :{EFFECT-AFFECT}

	BUFFS
