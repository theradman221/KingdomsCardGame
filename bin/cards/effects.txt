**Effect Templates** - effects is the name no matter how many there are
***Only change things in ALL CAPS from the template, everything else needs to stay as is***
"Effects" :{

	"EFFECT-NAME" : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT},
	"EFFECT-NAME" : {"Option1" : {EFFECT-AFFECT}, "Option2" : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT}}
},

Template for differing number / complexity of effects. Seperate each effect with ,'s. No comma if only 1 effect. This is to understand each line in the template above.

EFFECT-NAME : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT} - multiple effect-affects in one effect
EFFECT-NAME : {"Option1" : {EFFECT-AFFECT}, "Option2" : {EFFECT-AFFECT, EFFECT-AFFECT}} - Multiple possiblities for EffectAffects such as this or that, for each option start with "OptionNUMBER" :{EFFECT-AFFECT}
